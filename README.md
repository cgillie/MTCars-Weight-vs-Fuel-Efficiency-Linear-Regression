# MTCars-Weight-vs-Fuel-Efficiency-Linear-Regression
The purpose of this exercise is to implement a simple linear regression on a small dataset.
The author chose to implement a linear regression utilizing gradient descent to minimize the mean squared error cost function. The dataset used is the "Motor Trend Car Road Tests" dataset available from R at https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/versions/3.6.2/topics/mtcars
